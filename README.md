Hey! I'm an undergraduate freshman at UT Austin pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.

My current interests are...
* Software Engineering
* Robotics
* Machine Learning
* Research

... but I'm always looking to learn about new fields as I take more classes and start new [projects](./Projects.md).
