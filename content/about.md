I'm currently a sophomore undergrad at UT Austin pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science.

Here's a list of my current interests: 
* AI
* Software Engineering
* Mathematics
* Computer Hardware.

However, I'm always looking to learn about new fields as I take more [classes](../education), start new [projects](../projects), and land new [positions](../experience).

Feel free to reach out if you or anyone you know may be interested in working with me!
