:wave:  I graduated from UT Austin in May '23 with a BS degree in CS and have a passion for AI, ML, and Software Engineering. I currently work at Veeva Systems as an Associate SWE on the MyVeeva for Patients product.

I've explored these in my past [positions](../experience), [courses](../education), and [projects](../projects). I'm always looking to expand my interests and explore them in new ways.

Feel free to reach out if you or anyone you know may be interested in working with me!
