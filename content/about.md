:wave: I'm an undergraduate Senior in the CS program at UT Austin, graduating in May 2023.

My current interests include AI, Software Engineering, and Software Development. I've explored these in my past [positions](../experience), [courses](../education), and [projects](../projects). I'm always looking to expand my interests and explore them in new ways.

:exclamation: I am currently applying for 2023 Full Time Software roles. Feel free to reach out if you or anyone you know may be interested in working with me!
