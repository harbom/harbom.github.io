# Projects

Here are my most significant and recent projects. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/harishbommakanti) to see the source code and documentation for these projects and more.

## School Projects
Here are a list of significant projects worked on through my undergraduate courses at UT. Please note that these will not be publically visible on GitHub or the like.

### Terminal Shell
> Group project in CS 439: Operating Systems
- Built a shell application to process command-line Linux arguments and launch/coordinate process communication in C.
- Enabled built-in commands, path variables, file redirection, and concurrent commands.

Skills Demonstrated: `Operating System Design, Command Line Interpreters, System Calls, Concurrency`

Technologies Used: `C, Git, GitLab`

### Pintos Operating System
> Group projects in CS 439: Operating Systems
- Worked on the [Pintos operating system](https://pintos-os.org/), developed as part of the Stanford Operating Systems curriculum.
- Explored and added features to the threading, system call, virtual memory, and file storage systems.

Skills Demonstrated: `Operating System Design, Threads, Virtual Memory, System Calls, File Systems, Kernel Development, Concurrency`

Technologies Used: `C, Git, GitLab`

### Y86-64 System Emulator
> Individual project in CS 429: Computer Architecture
- Designed a simulator in C capable of executing assembly following Y86-64, a subset of the x86-64 architecture.
- Built a pipelined processor and a 2-level cache memory hierarchy to address realistic time and memory constraints.

Skills Demonstrated: `Pipelined Processor Implementation, Cache Controller Design, Assembly`

Technologies Used: `C, Git, GitHub`

### Dynamic Memory Manager
> Individual project in CS 429: Computer Architecture
- Developed a dynamic memory allocator in C to emulate `malloc()` and `free()` in the C standard library.
- Applied techniques such as coalescing, splitting, and search tactics to efficiently maintain memory.

Skills Demonstrated: `Memory Management Tactics, Data Structures (Linked Lists)`

Technologies Used: `C, Git, GitHub`

### EEL Command-line Interpreter
> Individual project in CS 429: Computer Architecture
- Built a command-line interpreter in C for the Expression Evaluation Language (EEL).
- Enabled language design concepts such as recursive descent parsing

Skills Demonstrated: `Language Design, Grammars, Recursive Descent Parsing, Variable Management, Data Structures (Trees, Maps)`

Technologies Used: `C, Git, GitHub`

## Personal Projects
Here are a few projects developed for personal interest, spanning miscellaneous topics.
