# Projects

Here are my most significant projects. Check out my [GitHub](github.com/harishbommakanti) to see the source code and documentation for these projects and more.

## Y86-64 System Emulator
- Designed a simulator in C capable of executing assembly following Y86-64, a subset of the x86-64 architecture.
- Built a pipelined processor and a 2-level cache memory hierarchy to address realistic time and memory constraints.

Skills Demonstrated: `Pipelined Processor Implementation, Cache Controller Design, Assembly`

Technologies Used: `C`

## Dynamic Memory Manager
- Developed a dynamic memory allocator in C to emulate `malloc()` and `free()` in the C standard library.
- Applied techniques such as coalescing, splitting, and search tactics to efficiently maintain memory.

Skills Demonstrated: `Memory Management Tactics, Data Structures (Linked Lists)`

Technologies Used: `C`

## EEL Command-line Interpreter
- Built a command-line interpreter in C for the Expression Evaluation Language (EEL).
- Enabled language design concepts such as recursive descent parsing

Skills Demonstrated: `Language Design, Grammars, Recursive Descent Parsing, Variable Management, Data Structures (Trees, Maps)`

Technologies Used: `C`

## Weather Prediction
- A CLI program in Python to predict weather given data from the past 5 days.
- Uses time series modeling to produce a multi-step forecast for 48 hours past the current time.

Skills Demonstrated: `CLI Development, API Usage, Time Series Forecasting`

Technologies Used: `Python, JavaScript`

## Rouse Robotics Scouting App
- Authored a web application to automate data gathering at robotics events using JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and Jekyll.
- Enabled both offline and online data aggregation for 50+ teams per event.

Skills Demonstrated: `Formal Code Reviews, App Deployment, UI/UX Design`

Technologies Used: `JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Jekyll`

## Mini-Projects
Here are projects that aren't massive, but were still very fun to build and taught me a lot.

### Project-Euler
- Although not technically a project, a compilation of solutions for the math and computer science coding questions on [Project-Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Skills Demonstrated: `Algorithm Design, Math, Data Structures`

Technologies Used: `Java, Python`

[Github](https://github.com/harishbommakanti/Project-Euler)

### Image Processor
- Built an image processor in Java which transforms images using operations such as blurring.

Skills Demonstrated: `CLI Development, Image Manipulation, Data Structures (Matrices)`

Technologies Used: `Java`

[GitHub](https://github.com/harishbommakanti/image_processor)

### Text Editor
- Wrote a small text editor with support for common operations, such as opening, saving, editing, and closing files.

Skills Demonstrated: `GUI Design`

Technologies Used: `Java, Java Swing`

[GitHub](https://github.com/harishbommakanti/Text-Editor)

### Conway's Game of Life
- Modeled Conway's Game of Life in Python, showing the progression of common cellular automata patterns.

Skills Demonstrated: `CLI Development, Data Structures (Matrices)`

Technologies used: `Python`
