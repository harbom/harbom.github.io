# Projects

## The Redaction Programming Language
- Wrote an Interpreter from scratch in Java for Redaction, a small scripting language formed around the core syntax of C based languages, Python, and Javascript.
- Goal of the project was to gain a deeper understanding of theoretical/practical language design as well as have fun at incorporating our own ideas.

Skills Demonstrated: `Data Structures/Algorithms, Programming Language/Interpreter Design`

Technologies Used: `Java`

## Weather Prediction Web App
- Built a website to predict the current day's weather based off of the past `n` days of weather data, such as humidity and air quality, using machine learning.

Skills Demonstrated: `App Deployment, UI/UX Design, Databases`

Technologies Used: `Go, MongoDB, Vue.js`

## Rouse Robotics Scouting App
- Published a web application for the schoolâ€™s robotics team to automate the process of gathering data from other teams robotics competitions.
- A large challenge is that an internet connection is illegal during competitions, so the app coped with loading local data during competitions and uploading the data to a server once exiting competitions, from multiple user endpoints.

Skills Demonstrated: `Formal code reviews, App deployment, UI/UX Design`

Technologies Used: `Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jekyll`

## Mini-Projects
Here are projects that aren't massive, but were still very fun to build and taught me a lot.

### Project-Euler
- Although not technically a project, a compilation of solutions for the math and computer science coding questions on [https://projecteuler.net/](https://projecteuler.net/)

Skills Demonstrated: `Algorithm Design, Math`

Technologies Used: `Java, Python`

[Github](https://github.com/harishbommakanti/Project-Euler)

### Image Processor
- Built an image processor in Java which transforms images using operations such as blurring.

Skills Demonstrated: `CLI Development, Image Manipulation`

Technologies Used: `Java`

[GitHub](https://github.com/harishbommakanti/image_processor)

### Text Editor
- Wrote a small text editor with support for common operations, such as opening, saving, editing, and closing files.

Skills Demonstrated: `GUI Design`

Technologies Used: `Java, Java Swing`
