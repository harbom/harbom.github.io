# Projects

This page lists the major projects I've been involved in but you can find the source code for these projects and more on [GitHub](https://github.com/harbom).

## The Redaction Programming Language
- Wrote an Interpreter from scratch in Java for Redaction, a toy programming language formed around the core syntax of C based languages.
- Goal of the project was to gain a deeper understanding of theoretical/practical language design as well as have fun at incorporating our own ideas.

Skills Demonstrated: **Data Structures/Algorithms, Programming Language/Interpreter Design**

Technologies Used: **Java**

[Website](), [GitHub](https://github.com/harbom/Redaction-Programming-Language)

## Convolutional Neural Network from Scratch for Handwritten Digit Classification
- Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch in Python to classify handwritten digits.

Skills Demonstrated: **Neural Network Design, Backend Data Processing, UI/UX Design**

Technologies Used: **Python, Flask**

[Website](), [GitHub](https://github.com/harbom/Digit-Classifier-Web-App)

## Weather Prediction Web Application
- Built a website to predict the current day's weather based off of the past `n` days of weather data, such as humidity and air quality, using machine learning.

Skills Demonstrated: **App Deployment, UI/UX Design, Databases**

Technologies Used: **Go, MongoDB, Vue.js**

[Website](), [GitHub](https://github.com/harbom/Weather-Prediction)

## Rouse Robotics Scouting App
- Published a web application for the schoolâ€™s robotics team to automate the process of gathering data from other teams robotics competitions.
- A large challenge is that an internet connection is illegal during competitions, so the app coped with loading local data during competitions and uploading the data to a server once exiting competitions, from multiple user endpoints.

Skills Demonstrated: **Formal code reviews, App deployment, UI/UX Design**

Technologies Used: **Javascript, HTML, CSS, Jekyll**
