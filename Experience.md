# Experience

## Robot Perception and Learning Lab

> **October 2020 - Present**

- Integrated and tuned a set of evaluations for the PPO reinforcement learning algorithm in Python to benchmark [Robosuite](http://robosuite.ai/), the modular robotics and robot learning framework.


## Computational Hydraulics Group Research Lab at UT Austin

> **Summer 2019**

- Ran simulations on TACC supercomputers using software developed by the CHG labs to simulate coastal models.
- Modified/created Python scripts using data science libraries such as Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pandas along with development tools such as Jupyter Notebooks to help visualize ADCIRC results.

## NASA SEES Internship

> **Summer 2018**

- STEM Enhancement in Earth Science (SEES) joint UT Austin and NASA summer internship
- Collected NWS Precipitation Estimation data via REST endpoints with JS frameworks to host on [UT Austinâ€™s CSR website](https://agw-prim-green2.csr.utexas.edu/SEES2018/).
- Developed a Python script to automate an extremely lengthy and manual task done by Dr. Porter from UT CSR.
- Simulated recent flood events with the goal of improving future flood response scenarios.
